We're now gonna ask you to come up with a better network.\n","\n","Here's a few tips:\n","\n","* __Go beyond SimpleRNN__: there's `keras.layers.LSTM` and `keras.layers.GRU`\n","  * If you want to use a custom recurrent Cell, read [this](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#rnn)\n","  * You can also use 1D Convolutions (`keras.layers.Conv1D`). They are often as good as recurrent layers but with less overfitting.\n","* __Stack more layers__: if there is a common motif to this course it's about stacking layers\n","  * You can just add recurrent and 1dconv layers on top of one another and keras will understand it\n","  * Just remember that bigger networks may need more epochs to train\n","* __Gradient clipping__: If your training isn't as stable as you'd like, set `clipnorm` in your optimizer.\n","  * Which is to say, it's a good idea to watch over your loss curve at each minibatch. Try tensorboard callback or something similar.\n","* __Regularization__: you can apply dropouts as usuall but also in an RNN-specific way\n","  * `keras.layers.Dropout` works inbetween RNN layers\n","  * Recurrent layers also have `recurrent_dropout` parameter\n","* __More words!__: You can obtain greater performance by expanding your model's input dictionary from 5000 to up to every single word!\n","  * Just make sure your model doesn't overfit due to so many parameters.\n","  * Combined with regularizers or pre-trained word-vectors this could be really good cuz right now our model is blind to >5% of words.\n","* __The most important advice__: don't cram in everything at once!\n","  * If you stuff in a lot of modiffications, some of them almost inevitably gonna be detrimental and you'll never know which of them are.\n","  * Try to instead go in small iterations and record experiment results to guide further search.\n","  \n","There's some advanced stuff waiting at the end of

We strongly suggest that you try them _after_ you've got a good initial model.\n","* __Use pre-trained embeddings__: you can use pre-trained weights from [there](http://ahogrammer.com/2017/01/20/the-list-of-pretrained-word-embeddings/) to kickstart your Embedding layer.\n","  * Embedding layer has a matrix W (layer.W) which contains word embeddings for each word in the dictionary. You can just overwrite them with tf.assign.\n","  * When using pre-trained embeddings, pay attention to the fact that model's dictionary is different from your own.\n","  * You may want to switch trainable=False for embedding layer in first few epochs as in regular fine-tuning.  \n","* __More efficient batching__: right now TF spends a lot of time iterating over \"0\"s\n","  * This happens because batch is always padded to the length of a longest sentence\n","  * You can speed things up by pre-generating batches of similar lengths and feeding it with randomly chosen pre-generated batch.\n","  * This technically breaks the i.i.d. assumption, but it works unless you come up with some insane rnn architectures.\n","* __Structured loss functions__: since we're tagging the whole sequence at once, we might as well train our network to do so.\n","  * There's more than one way to do so, but we'd recommend starting with [Conditional Random Fields](http://blog.echen.me/2012/01/03/introduction-to-conditional-random-fields/)\n","  * You could plug CRF as a loss function and still train by backprop. There's even some neat tensorflow [implementation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.crf) for you.\n"]}]}
